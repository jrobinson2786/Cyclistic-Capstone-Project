# Cyclistic-Capstone-Project
## Project Overview:
This is the coding portion of the capstone project for the Google - Data Analytics Professional Certificate, offered through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics), which is intended to showcase some of the various technical skills that I learned during the course of the program in addition to some additional skills I've picked up on my own and through the data community. For this project, we were given the choice between 2 case-studies to complete or the option to create our own project. For my first project, I decided to choose 1 of the 2 hypothetical case studies, Cyclistic, a fictitious Bike-Share company based in Chicago. For this particular project, I used Excel for some initail data transformation and SQL through Google - BigQuery for the data aggregation and analysis. 

## Cyclistic: 
Cyclistic is a Chicago-based bike share company which launched its initial bike-share offering in 2016.

## Business Objective: 
It has been determined by the financial analytics team that annual members are more profitable for the long-term than casual riders. It follows that my task for this project, as the newest member of the marketing team, is to analyze bike-ride data to determine the key differences between casual riders (ie: riders that use Cyclistic bikes on a pay-per-ride basis) and annual members. The purpose of the analysis is ultimately to provide insight toward Cyclistic's next marketing campain aimed at the conversion of casual riders to annual members.
