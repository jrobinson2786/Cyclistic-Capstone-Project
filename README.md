# Cyclistic-Capstone-Project
## Project Overview:
This is the capstone project for the Google - Data Analytics Professional Certificate which is intended to showcase the various programs and technical skills that I learned during the course of the program. We were given the choice between 2 case-studies to complete or the option to create our own project. For my first project, I decided to choose 1 of the 2 case studies, Cyclistic, a Bike-Share company based in Chicago. For this particular project, I used Excel for some initail data transformation and SQL through Google - BigQuery for the data aggregation and analysis. 

## Cyclistic: 
Cyclistic is a Chicago-based bike share company which launched its initial bike-share offering in 2016.

## Additional Information: 
Full project coming soon..
