# Cyclistic-Capstone-Project
## Project Overview:
This is the capstone project for the Google - Data Analytics Professional Certificate which is intended to showcase the various programs and technical skills that I learned during the course of the program. We were given the choice between 2 case-studies to complete or the option to create our own project. For my first project, I decided to choose 1 of the 2 hypothetical case studies, Cyclistic, a fictitious Bike-Share company based in Chicago. For this particular project, I used Excel for some initail data transformation and SQL through Google - BigQuery for the data aggregation and analysis. 

## Cyclistic: 
Cyclistic is a Chicago-based bike share company which launched its initial bike-share offering in 2016.

## Business Objective: 
It has been determined by the financial analytics team that annual members are more profitable for the long-term than casual riders. It follows that my task for this project, as the newest member of the marketing team, is to analyze bike-ride data to determine the key differences between casual riders (ie: riders that use Cyclistic bikes on a pay-per-ride basis) and annual members. The purpose of the analysis is ultimately to provide insight toward Cyclistic's next marketing campain aimed at the conversion of casual riders to annual members.
