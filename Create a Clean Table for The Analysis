----------------------------------------------------------------------

------- 1. isolate electric_bike rides from master set. 

CREATE TABLE cyclistic_capstone.electric_rides
AS(
  SELECT * 
  FROM cyclistic_capstone.trips_compl
  WHERE rideable_type = 'electric_bike'
);

------- double check electric_bike rides table
SELECT * 
FROM cyclistic_capstone.electric_rides
LIMIT 150;



------- 2. clean nulls
CREATE TABLE cyclistic_capstone.clean_prelim
AS(
  SELECT * 
  FROM cyclistic_capstone.trips_compl
  WHERE 
    rideable_type <> 'electric_bike' AND 
    start_station_name IS NOT NULL AND

    start_lat IS NOT NULL AND 
    end_lat IS NOT NULL AND 
    start_lng IS NOT NULL AND 
    end_lng IS NOT NULL
);

------- double check preliminary cleaning table

SELECT * 
FROM cyclistic_capstone.clean_prelim

------- 3. reintegrate electric rides. 
CREATE TABLE cyclistic_capstone.total_clean
AS(
  SELECT * 
  FROM cyclistic_capstone.clean_prelim
  UNION ALL 

  SELECT * 
  FROM cyclistic_capstone.electric_rides

------- double check total clean
SELECT *
