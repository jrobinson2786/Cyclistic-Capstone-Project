-----------------Create Clean Table for Analysis----------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------

------- 1. isolate electric_bike rides from master set. 
CREATE TABLE cyclistic_capstone.trips_clean_final AS
WITH electric_bikes AS
(
SELECT * 
FROM cyclistic_capstone.trips_compl
WHERE rideable_type = 'electric_bike'
),
------- 2. clean nulls from bike types that are NOT electric bikes
other_bikes AS 
(
  SELECT * 
  FROM cyclistic_capstone.trips_compl 
  WHERE 
    rideable_type <> 'electric_bike' AND 
    start_station_name IS NOT NULL AND

    start_lat IS NOT NULL AND 
    end_lat IS NOT NULL AND 
    start_lng IS NOT NULL AND 
    end_lng IS NOT NULL
),
------- 3. reintegrate ALL bike types. 
reintegrated_rides AS 
(
  SELECT * 
  FROM electric_bikes 
  UNION ALL 

  SELECT * 
  FROM other_bikes
)
------- 4. create clean_master_table with transformations.
